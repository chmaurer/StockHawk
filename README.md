Udacity StockHawk Project

## Introduction
The Udacity StockHawk Project is a project created for my Udacity Android Developer Nano Degree. I used the initial sources of Udacity to implement certain functions.

## Getting Started
Feel free to check out the project. It should run on most devices actually.

## Implemented Features
The application allows you to add multiple stocks and track their performance. Also, a widget is included which can be added to the home screen.
